# Machine_Learning_Project
 Teaching myself / getting into machine learning


# Project Description
Initially this project was my first crack at machine learning. I then shifted over to turning it into my own project to help my girlfriend in planning her graduation banquet.

I wanted to train a model to organize and seat people for banquettes. This turned out to be an inificient to help because I needed input data which I didnt have at the time.

Honestly not to sure, its a mess right now, I have put this project on the back burner to focus more on my react native project.
I will come back and update this in the future... I think.
